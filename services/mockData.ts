    ],
    notesContent: `## Percentage, Profit & Loss — Formulas & Tricks

### Percentage Basics
- **x% of y** = (x × y) ÷ 100
- **% change** = (Change ÷ Original) × 100
- **Increase by x%**: New = Original × (1 + x/100)
- **Decrease by x%**: New = Original × (1 - x/100)

### Quick % Table (Memorize!)
| Fraction | % |
|:---|:---|
| 1/2 | 50% |
| 1/3 | 33.33% |
| 1/4 | 25% |
| 1/5 | 20% |
| 1/8 | 12.5% |
| 1/10 | 10% |

### Profit & Loss Formulas
- **Profit** = SP − CP
- **Loss** = CP − SP
- **Profit %** = (Profit ÷ CP) × 100
- **SP** = CP × (100 + Profit%) ÷ 100
- **CP** = SP × 100 ÷ (100 + Profit%)

### Shortcut Tricks
- If profit = x% and loss = x%, net result = **Loss of (x²/100)%**
- Successive discounts of a% and b% = effective discount of **(a + b − ab/100)%**

### Practice Examples
> A shopkeeper buys an article for ₹500 and sells at 20% profit. SP = 500 × 120/100 = **₹600**

> An article is sold at ₹540 at 8% profit. CP = 540 × 100/108 = **₹500**`

    ],
    notesContent: `## Ratio, Time & Work, Speed-Distance — Key Formulas

### Ratio & Proportion
- Ratio a:b = a/b
- If a:b = c:d → a×d = b×c (cross multiplication)
- **Compound Ratio** of a:b and c:d = ac:bd

### Time & Work
- If A can do work in **n** days → A's 1 day work = **1/n**
- If A does 1/n and B does 1/m per day → Together = **1/n + 1/m**
- **Total time together** = nm/(n+m) days

#### Trick: Work Equivalence
> If 6 men do work in 12 days:
> Total work = 6 × 12 = **72 man-days**
> For 9 men → 72 ÷ 9 = **8 days**

### Speed, Distance, Time
- **Speed** = Distance ÷ Time
- **Distance** = Speed × Time
- **Average Speed** = 2S₁S₂/(S₁+S₂) [for equal distances]

### Trains
- Train passing a **pole** (stationary point): Distance = Length of train
- Train crossing a **platform**: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform
- Two trains in **same direction**: Relative Speed = |S₁ − S₂|
- Two trains in **opposite direction**: Relative Speed = S₁ + S₂

### Simple & Compound Interest
- **SI** = P × R × T / 100
- **CI** = P × (1 + R/100)ᵀ − P
- If money doubles in n years (CI) → it becomes 8x in **3n years**`

    ],
    notesContent: `## Number Series & Coding-Decoding

### Number Series — Common Patterns
1. **Arithmetic Series**: Add/subtract a fixed number (e.g., 3,6,9,12... +3)
2. **Geometric Series**: Multiply/divide by a fixed number (e.g., 2,6,18,54... ×3)
3. **Square Series**: 1,4,9,16,25... (n²)
4. **Cube Series**: 1,8,27,64,125... (n³)
5. **Prime Series**: 2,3,5,7,11,13... (prime numbers)
6. **Mixed/Alternate**: Two alternate series mixed together

### How to Solve Series Questions
- Step 1: Find differences between consecutive terms
- Step 2: If differences are constant → Arithmetic
- Step 3: If differences form a pattern → find that pattern
- Step 4: Check for squares/cubes if differences grow rapidly

### Coding-Decoding — Rules
**Type 1 — Letter Shift**: Each letter shifted by fixed positions
- A→D, B→E... (shift +3) or Z→W, Y→X... (shift -3)

**Type 2 — Reverse Alphabet**: A=Z, B=Y, C=X...
- A(1)→Z(26), B(2)→Y(25)

**Type 3 — Number Coding**
- A=1, B=2... Z=26 OR A=26, B=25... Z=1

### Example
> If MANGO → NBPHI (each letter +1), then APPLE → ?
> A+1=B, P+1=Q, P+1=Q, L+1=M, E+1=F → **BQQMF**`

3. **Part & Whole**: Chapter → Book :: Room → House
4. **Synonym/Antonym**: Day → Night :: Hot → Cold

### Blood Relation — Key Terms
| English | Relation |
|:---|:---|
| Father's/Mother's son | Brother |
| Father's/Mother's daughter | Sister |
| Father's brother | Uncle (চাচা/জেঠা) |
| Mother's brother | Maternal Uncle (মামা) |
| Father's sister | Aunt (ফুপু/পিসি) |
| Husband's/Wife's father | Father-in-law |

### Solving Technique — Use a Family Tree
1. Draw each person as a node
2. Use arrows to show parent-child relation
3. Use horizontal lines for siblings/spouses
4. Count the steps to find the relation

### Example
> "A is B's father. C is A's sister. D is C's mother. What is D to B?"
> D → C (mother) → A (sibling) → B (child)
> D is B's **Grandmother (দিদিমা/ঠাকুরমা)**`

2. **Second Law**: Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma)
3. **Third Law**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

- Speed of sound in air: **343 m/s (at 20°C)**
- Acceleration due to gravity: **9.8 m/s²** (use 10 for quick calculation)
- Boiling point of water: **100°C = 373 K**
- Freezing point of water: **0°C = 273 K**

### Electricity
- **Ohm's Law**: V = IR (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
- **Power**: P = VI = I²R = V²/R
- **Series Circuit**: Total R = R₁ + R₂ + R₃
- **Parallel Circuit**: 1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃`
